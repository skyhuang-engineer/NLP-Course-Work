      " years of pathetic service disgusting food and dangerous mistakes why do i keep going back?having nothing to do with macdonald food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody i have been going to this particular store for years it is right around the corner from where i used to live and is on the way from where i live to pretty much everything i use (gas station costco movie theater market etc) it is the only convenient location and for a while macdonald was the only place that had $1 drinks so those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place service: i used to be a manager with another fast food chain i know what service should be i also know what it usually is it doesn't have to be 5 star but the rude attitudes ridiculously slow service and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much when i say slow service i am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda correct orders: yes my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup add big mac sauce) but when i thought they could do no worse they messed up an order for 4 large drinks 2 diet cokes a lemonade and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice) we received a regular coke a lemonade a dr pepper and a sweet iced tea 2 drinks had no ice at all and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around we have never received a correct order from this store ever i could go on and on about it but i will stick with this sad example and move ondangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before i received them an egg that was completely raw in the middle and tonights lovely mess up tonight i ordered the angus mushroom and swiss according to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms i had about a teaspoon of mushrooms no sauce and 1/2 a slice of cheese that is right they left off a slice and a half of cheese in addition it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty not the big ole angus patty they should have used i have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office they consistently send out a free burger or drink coupon to apologize they tell me how sorry they are and suggest i try one of their other locations as this is the only one they receive complaints from from what i was told they are revamping this store but i have been told that for well over a year and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill which i didn't think was even possible i keep vowing this will be my last visit but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if i will ever receive my food i highly do not recommend this location hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me -sarah (this was written by paul's wife because i am usually the one dealing with them i guess he got smarter) \n",

      " if i were to die and go to hell this macdonald would certainly provide a worthy backdrop for a nightmare imaginedlet's begin the story of my worst dinner of my life at this sad little stop in a strip mall of no particular visual appeal under a bleak and cold chicago evening all things being fair the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances i won't get into hereupon stepping to the counter i gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a macdonald express which is a new concept to me all-together i decided to play it safe with the classic burger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka \"the value meal\" my meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server the food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? i could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers at this point i made a snap substitution request no coke coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother my server obligated me in silence and i acknowledged her generosity i took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restauranti sat down and emptied the contents of the bag fries and napkins no ketchup i tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption but alas no they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat i fetched several ketchup packets from the server kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my tablespilling out the ketchup packets on the table i noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets no turning back now i dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself so to sum up:fries they left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer the luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down maybe some beer would have helped the processburger lifting the top bun of any burger you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation though consumable the burger were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long also lukewarmcoffee i have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room it was watery lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffeeketchup packets looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchupcustomer service no complaints here it's not exactly the most cheery place to work servers were speedy helpful and responsive \n",

      " i've eaten at nougatine and abc kitchen numerous times but i have to admit that i keep coming back to this fine institution for a great meal that puts jgv's work to shame the french fries are an example of potatoes that have been prepared in a form that may be legitimately considered a work of art the gentle texture and crisp of the fries are testament to the corporation's impeccable execution of deep frying and the training that the personnel have undergone to achieve this perfection across the franchise is very much laudable my experience with the beef has been nothing short of flawless as i had requested the patty in my burger was prepared to a medium-rare and the subtle cheese and softly-grated onions danced with the rich ketchup and mustard on my tongue as i tasted thick and quality processed meat between two pieces of toasted and warm buns the acidity of the salted fries and that of the burger did not balance quite as i liked it though i was very much satisfied anyway i have to say that short of make-up sex i have had no better experience in my 20's to finish my three-course the apple pies were magnificent the texture of the apples led me to believe that they were in fact potatoes but i must commend macdonald for aptly managing their resources and overhead by taking advantage of economies of scale in purchasing only mass quantities of one ingredient as opposed to diversifying their portfolio; this may lead to higher margins in that the franchises would be able to provide more products in their menu eg genuine apple smoothies or apple-infused panacotta but would ultimately lead to higher operating costs in any case the dessert was very much satisfyingthough i paid only $600 for this meal i must have gained the delight of a $6000 meal cheers to an amazing institution for providing a meal aptly suited for all social castes \n",
